# Alfred Workflows by Jed

These are the workflows that I've created for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).

- [Length](Length.alfredworkflow): Quickly calculate the length of a piece of text.

- [Open Tot](Open%20Tot.alfredworkflow): Activate the [Tot](https://tot.rocks/) menu bar app.

- [ProjectPicker](https://github.com/j-f1/ProjectPicker): Nearly instantly open any project youâ€™ve ever created in GitHub Desktop, Terminal, or the appropriate IDE.
